        FILM SUBMISSION
        <br>    Interested in how a simple voicemail could be visualized and used to tell a story.
        <br>
        Using any voicemail message from the archive, create a film that centers the act of listening. We recommend you avoid repeatedly playing the message and practice creating from intuition, using any camera available to you. The intent is for instinctual and spontaneous creation with no strings attached. Your response could be anything from narrative, experimental, video portraits, animation, landscapes, dance, or listening to a voicemail for the first time in front of your webcam. There is no limit to the number of submissions and no experience is required.
        <br>
        The audio should be the voicemail file, available as an MP3 for download. If you do choose to use music, it must be either original or royalty free. Your film can be edited using any video editing software, app, or website. There are many free and intuitive options. We also welcome unedited footage, as long as the voicemail can be heard. If you are experiencing issues or require assistance uploading your film, contact us at 18888glitch@gmail.com
        <br>
        All entries that follow the guidelines will be accepted and uploaded to the website within 48 hours. The participant(s) must agree to the terms & conditions.

        <br>
        What should I say when I call?
        Your call can be anything from a catch up, memory, declaration, impression, apology, lesson, boundary, regret, or eulogy. Whatever you have been left with by someone who passed through their life. Interpret it as you wish– whether fiction or fact.
        <br>
        Why create a film using a voicemail?
        Creating a film from an anonymous voicemail offers new life and visual perspective to the lost connection. As a filmmaker, I took a lengthy hiatus from making films and did not know where to begin again. Voicemails can offer inspiration to create a visual work of up to two minutes, using any camera available.
        <br>
        Maybe you are an artist who is stuck, looking for a prompt or permission to create your next project. Maybe you’re bored and need something to do. Or, maybe you have never created a film and this is your chance. We are a non-judgemental platform that welcomes all backgrounds and experiences. We encourage the use of practical tools, such as phones or webcams, mitigating the technical requirements that can often come with filmmaking.
        <br>
        Do I have to use the full two minutes when I call?
        No. Either hang up when you’re finished, or press 3 to review your message. Please note: if you do not make noise for more than 10 seconds, you may be disconnected. You will get the chance to listen back and re-record your message if this happens.
        <br>
        For audio quality, is it better that I leave my message from indoors or in a quiet space?
        Call from wherever you are, whenever you feel like calling, and talk as you typically would. All voicemails will be slightly adjusted for clarity, but there will be a range of audio qualities– that’s the nature of the project.
        <br>
        Should I leave my message knowing it could be used as the audio of a film?
        Not necessarily. We’d like to think that they are separate entities that are elevating one another autonomously.
        <br>
        Will transcripts of the voicemails be available?
        Not at the moment. We are a very small operation, but there is a possibility of offering transcriptions in the future. However, all films that are submitted will be closed captioned.
        <br>
        I got the audio from your website, but I want to submit my film to a different platform, is this allowed?
        1-8888-GLITCH is a non-exclusive platform, so you’re welcome to take your film wherever you would like. We will do our best to highlight new contributions on our social media, but self-promotion of your film is encouraged. If you choose to go another route, we would appreciate that you credit the platform for providing the voicemail message.
        <br>
        Why has it been a week and my contribution is still not on the platform?
        All voicemail and film submissions will be accepted if they abide by our terms & conditions. If your submission is not uploaded after a week, either it has failed to comply or there has been an error. You’re always welcome to email us at 18888glitch@gmail.com
        <br>
        Do I have a date I need to submit by?
        The project is currently open-ended, so there is no deadline at this time. To stay updated, follow us on Instagram.
