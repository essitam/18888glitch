# Blob

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thisis/pen/eYvaNQB](https://codepen.io/thisis/pen/eYvaNQB).

This blob is made up of a series of points positioned using polar coordinates. The points animate along their distance coordinate using a basic spring algorithm interpolated along their neighbours in response to mouse movement.

I would appreciate it, if you end up using this code in any sort of production situation, that you cite me in your code and let me know what you've used it for. I love seeing that people actually get use out of the things that I write, and I don't think it's too much to ask that I get a citation for my troubles :)
